<h2 class='title'>Introduction</h2>

<p>The CUPS library provides a whole collection of interfaces
needed to support the internal needs of the CUPS software as well
as the needs of applications, filters, printer drivers, and
backends.</p>

<p>Unlike the rest of CUPS, the CUPS API library is provided
under the GNU Library General Public License. This means that you
can use the CUPS API library in both proprietary and open-source
programs.</p>

<h2 class='title'>General Usage</h2>

<p>The <var>&lt;cups/cups.h&gt;</var> header file must be included to
use the CUPS functions.</p>

<p>Programs using these functions must be linked to the CUPS
library: <var>libcups.a</var>, <var>libcups.so.2</var>,
<var>libcups.2.dylib</var>, <var>libcups_s.a</var>, or
<var>libcups2.lib</var> depending on the platform. The following
command compiles <var>myprogram.c</var> using GCC and the CUPS
library:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcups</kbd>
</pre>

<h2 class='title'>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, the CUPS API functions require
CUPS 1.1 or higher.</p>
