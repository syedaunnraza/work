<h2 class='title'>Introduction</h2>

<p>The CUPS file and directory APIs provide portable interfaces
for manipulating files and listing files and directories. Unlike
stdio <tt>FILE</tt> streams, the <tt>cupsFile</tt> functions
allow you to open more than 256 files at any given time. They
also manage the platform-specific details of locking, large file
support, line endings (CR, LF, or CR LF), and reading and writing
files using Flate ("gzip") compression. Finally, you can also
connect, read from, and write to network connections using the
<tt>cupsFile</tt> functions.</p>

<p>The <tt>cupsDir</tt> functions manage the platform-specific
details of directory access/listing and provide a convenient way
to get both a list of files and the information (permissions,
size, timestamp, etc.) for each of those files.</p>

<p>The CUPS scheduler (<tt>cupsd</tt>), <tt>mailto</tt> notifier,
and many of the CUPS API functions use these functions for
everything except console (stdin, stdout, stderr) I/O.</p>

<h2 class='title'>General Usage</h2>

<p>The <var>&lt;cups/dir.h&gt;</var> and
<var>&lt;cups/file.h&gt;</var> header files must be included to
use the <tt>cupsDir</tt> and <tt>cupsFile</tt> functions,
respectively.</p>

<p>Programs using these functions must be linked to the CUPS
library: <var>libcups.a</var>, <var>libcups.so.2</var>,
<var>libcups.2.dylib</var>, <var>libcups_s.a</var>, or
<var>libcups2.lib</var> depending on the platform. The following
command compiles <var>myprogram.c</var> using GCC and the CUPS
library:</p>

<pre class='command'>
<kbd>gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lcups</kbd>
</pre>

<h2 class='title'>Compatibility</h2>

<p>All of these functions require CUPS 1.2 or higher.</p>
