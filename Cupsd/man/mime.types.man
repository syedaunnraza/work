.SH NAME
mime.types \- mime type description file for cups
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fImime.types\fR file defines the recognized file types.
.LP
Additional file types can be added to \fImime.types\fR or
(preferably) in additional files in the CUPS configuration
directory with the extension ".types".
.LP
Each line in the \fImime.types\fR file is a comment, blank, or
rule line. Comment lines start with the # character. Rule lines
start with the MIME type name and are optionally followed by a
series of file recognition rules that are used to automatically
identify print and web files:
.br
.nf

    super/type rule [ ... ruleN]
.fi
The rules may be grouped using parenthesis, joined using "+" for a
logical AND and "," or whitespace for a logical OR, and negated using
"!".
.SH RULES
Rules take two forms - a filename extension by itself and functions with test
values inside parenthesis. The following functions are available:
.TP 5
match("pattern")
.br
Pattern match on filename
.TP 5

.br
True if bytes are valid printable ASCII (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126)
.TP 5
printable(offset,length)
.br
True if bytes are printable 8-bit chars (CR, NL, TAB, BS, 32-126, 128-254)
.TP 5
string(offset,"string")
.br
True if bytes are identical to string
.TP 5
istring(offset,"string")
.br
True if a case-insensitive comparison of the bytes is identical
.TP 5
char(offset,value)
.br
True if byte is identical
.TP 5
short(offset,value)
.br
True if 16-bit integer is identical
.TP 5
int(offset,value)
.br
True if 32-bit integer is identical
.TP 5
locale("string")
.br
True if current locale matches string
.TP 5
contains(offset,range,"string")

containing whitespace and angle brackets (<>) for hexadecimal
strings.
