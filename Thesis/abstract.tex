Recent hardware virtualization schemes have not provided the same
performance benefits to managed code applications as they have to most other
applications. 

This project focuses on optimizing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
for high performance; specifically, it targets the performance of 
Hadoop benchmarks running on Windows Azure clusters. 

We hoped to: identify areas of the
JVM that cause excessive traps to the hypervisor and instead use
instructions that do not need emulation; and, to optimize the garbage
collector and memory manager around the unique TLB constraints that
multiple VMs running concurrently on a hardware virtualization present.

Using a combination of simple optimizations tailored for virtual
execution environments, we were able to improve the 
performance of the JVM by as much as 30 percent on some benchmarks
and by 500 percent on some micr-benchmarks.
