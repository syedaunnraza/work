\title{Can {\em Silhouette Execution} solve the VM Boot Storm Problem?}

\author{Syed Aunn Hasan Raza}
% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\
%                    S.M., Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981)}
\prevdegrees{S.B., Computer Science and Engineering, M.I.T., May 2010}
\department{Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.
\degreemonth{September}
\degreeyear{2011}
\thesisdate{September 1, 2011}

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.  
%\copyrightnoticetext{\copyright IBM, 1990.  Do not open till Xmas.}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.
\supervisor{Dr. Saman P. Amarasinghe}{Professor}

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee
% chairman.  You should replace this with your Department's Committee
% Chairman.
\chairman{Dr. Christopher J. Terman}{Chairman, Masters of Engineering Thesis Committee}

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\cleardoublepage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.
% \setcounter{page}{\thesavepage}
% \begin{abstractpage}

\section*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Professor Saman Amarasinghe for his huge role in both this project 
and my wonderful undergraduate experience at MIT. Saman was my professor for 6.005 (Spring 2008), 
6.197/6.172 (Fall 2009) and 6.035 (Spring 2009). These three exciting semesters 
not only convinced me of his unparalleled genius, but also ignited my interest in computer systems.  
Over the past year, as I have experienced the highs and lows of research, I have 
really benefited from Saman's infinite insight, encouragement and patience. 
 
As an M-Eng student, I have been blessed to work with two truly inpsirational and gifted people from the COMMIT group:
Marek Olszewski and Qin Zhao. Their expertise and brilliance is probably only eclipsed by their humility and 
helpfulness. I have learned more from Marek and Qin than I probably realize, and
their knowledge of operating systems
and dynamic instrumentation is invaluable and, frankly, immensely intimidating. 
I hope to emulate (or even approximate) their excellence some day.

This past year, I have also had the opportunity to work with Professor Srini Devadas, 
Professor Fraans Kaashoek, and Professor Dina Katabi as a TA for 6.005 and 6.033. It has been an extraordinarily
rewarding experience, and I have learned tremendously from simply interacting with these peerless individuals. Professor
Dina Katabi was especially kind to me for letting me work in G916 over the past few months.

I would like to thank Abdul Munir, whom I have known since my first day at MIT; 
I simply don't deserve the unflinchingly loyal and supportive friend I have found in him. 
I am also indebted to Osama Badar, Usman Masood, Brian Joseph, and Nabeel Ahmed
for their unrelenting support and encouragement; this past year would have been especially 
boring without our never-ending arguments and unproductive `all-nighters'.
I also owe a debt of gratitude to my partners-in-crime Prannay Budhraja, Ankit Gordhandas, Daniel Firestone 
and Maciej Pacula, who have been great friends and collaborators over the past few years. 
\newpage
I am humbled by the countless sacrifices made by my family in order for me to be where I am today. 
My father has been the single biggest inspiration and support in my life since childhood.
He epitomizes, for me, the meaning of selflessness and resilience.
This thesis, my work and few achievements were enabled by -- and dedicated to -- him, my mother and my two siblings Ali and Zahra. Ali has been a calming influence during my years at MIT; the strangest
(and most unproductive) obsessions unite us, ranging from Chinese \emph{Wuxia} fiction to,
more recently, \emph{The Game of Thrones}. Zahra's high-school math problems
have been a welcome distraction over the past year; they have also allowed me to appear
smarter than I truly am.

Finally, I would like to thank my wife Amina for her unwavering love and support throughout my stay at MIT, 
for improving and enriching my life every single day since I have known her, and for
knowing me better than even I know myself. 
Through her, I have also met two exceptional individuals, Drs. Fatima and Anwer Basha,
  whom I have already learnt a lot from.  \newline
